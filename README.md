Cortisol
----------

I started writing this app to give an alert whenever I needed to take a cortisol supplement for Adrenal Insufficiency. 
This straightforward app has one button and two timers: one for four hours and another for eight. The app triggers an alarm 
whenever one of the timers reaches zero. 

I can add new features for other use cases on demand, but the initial goal for this app is just personal use.

I will make an iOS version whenever I switch to an iPhone.

Please contact me if you found this app useful for you. My goal is not to make a profit but to help people with a similar medical condition.
